          This iNotebook app is just like an old-school paper notebookâ€”except
          it's for your digital life. iNotebook stands out for its
          consumer-friendly approach and you get an app that is hard to ignore.
          We highly recommend iNotebook, and encourage teachers, students and
          professionals to think about how it could make their life, work, and
          studies easier.

          iNotebook is about writing in any form and shape: jot down notes and
          memos, write diary entries, collect information for a research paper,
          or type the chapters of a novel. No matter how big or small your
          writing needs, iNotebook is the right place.
